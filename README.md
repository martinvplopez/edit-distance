# Levenshtein (Edit) distance problem
## This problem counts the cost of making two strings equals having three possible operations with unitary cost: insertion, deletion and sustitution.
### Example:
#### String 1: "cat" String 2: "cut" -> distance= 1
#### String 1: "sunday" String 2: "saturday" -> distance= 3
